    <h2>The Middle Seat Nobody Sees</h2>
    <p>Coral didn’t grow up in chaos—just in a house where silence spoke louder than words. He was the middle child, which some say is the hardest seat in a family: not the proud firstborn, not the adored youngest. Just... in between. That’s how most of his life felt—like he was always in between things. In between praise and blame. In between being seen and being ignored.</p>

    <p>His parents weren’t cruel, just strict and selective with their attention. When his siblings failed, they were guided. When he failed, he was questioned. “Why did you do that?” “You should’ve known better.” But when he succeeded? The room stayed quiet. No nod. No mention. Just silence.</p>

    <p>So he learned early on: approval isn’t promised, but expectation always is.</p>

    <p>In school, Coral became the one who always had his act together. The one people copied notes from, the one who helped others fix their code or navigate deadlines. A walking answer sheet. Reliable. Helpful. But no one asked <em>how</em> he managed. Or <em>if</em> he was okay. It was just assumed—“Carl’s smart,” “Carl can handle it.”</p>

    <p>The truth? Most nights, he stared at his ceiling until 5 a.m., thoughts looping like corrupted files. Not because he was overthinking assignments—but because he was overthinking <em>himself</em>. Who was he outside of being useful?</p>

    <h2>The Mask of Strength</h2>
    <p>College didn’t change much—just added new layers of pressure. Coral chose Information Systems not just for its practicality, but because it gave him structure. Systems made sense. They were logical, manageable, debug-able. People? Not so much.</p>

    <p>He built a reputation again: efficient, insightful, sharp. ENTJ to the bone—leading group projects, thinking ten steps ahead, never backing down from a challenge. But underneath all that efficiency was a boy who still felt invisible unless he was <em>fixing something</em>. A person who feared that if he stopped being helpful, he’d just <em>fade away</em>.</p>

    <div class="quote">“I don’t even know who I am if I’m not being what everyone else needs.”</div>

    <p>He doesn’t talk about the mornings where he rehearses asking for help, only to delete the message. Or how he sometimes slows down walking home, hoping the streetlights notice him. Or how he still wishes someone would sit next to him, in silence, just to say: <em>I see you.</em></p>

    <h2>Why He Keeps Going</h2>
    <p>Coral doesn’t believe in birthday wishes anymore, but he still makes plans. He journals conversations he’ll never have, and saves photos he never posts. Maybe part of him is archiving a self that feels too fragile for the real world.</p>

    <p>He says he keeps going for others. But part of him—just part—keeps going for the hope that <em>someone, someday, will choose to see the real him</em>. Not the “leader,” not the “smart one,” not the “problem-solver.” Just <strong>Coral</strong>—quiet, cracked, but still here.</p>

    <p>And maybe that’s the point. He was never just the filler between siblings. He was never just the guy who had it all together. He was always more than that.</p>

    <p><strong>Someone just had to look closer.</strong></p>
